From time to time I provide independent advice in areas like data standards, AI ethics and systems-based approaches to technology implementation. 

I'm efficient, effective and creative in how I approach my work. I'm
passionate about helping people and organisations use data more
effectively. If you have a project or an idea you'd like some help
with, email me using the contact form on the [About
page](http://ellenbroad.com/about/).
